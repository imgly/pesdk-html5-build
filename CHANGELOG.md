## 4.0.0

PhotoEditorSDK for HTML5 v4.0.0 comes with an all-new user interface designed
and optimized for desktop browsers!

This version contains many API changes. Please refer to our documentation for
the new API: Click [here](https://docs.photoeditorsdk.com/guides/html5/v4-ReactUI)
for the ReactUI and [here](https://docs.photoeditorsdk.com/guides/html5/v4-DesktopUI)
for our new DesktopUI.

**Please note:** With version 4.0.0, you will need to pass in your license file
as a string using the `license` option - both to our UIs as well as the SDK
itself (in case you're using the PhotoEditorSDK class manually). You can obtain
your license, please sign in on our [website](https://www.photoeditorsdk.com/login).

### Added

- Our UIs now have the ability to load custom font faces from .woff files
- Added a new `overlay` operation that places an asset onto the image with
  a specific blend mode
- Added two new blur operations: `gaussian` (blurs the whole image) and `linear`
  (linear gradient blur). The previous `linear` blur is now called `mirrored`.
- Added a 3D Lookup Table filter that can apply color filters using a 3D LUT
  image. All our default filters are based on this technology now. This also
  means that you can now use your iOS and Android filters on HTML5 as well.
  Please refer to our [documentation](https://docs.photoeditorsdk.com/guides/html5/v4-DesktopUI/features/filters)
  to learn more about this feature and how to create your own filters.
- Added a new serialization format (3.0.0) which has been designed for cross-
  platform serialization.
- Our new UI adds controls for various new internal features such as sticker
  opacity and sticker tinting.

### Changed

- Replaced our default sticker packs with two new sticker packs: `emoticons`
  and `shapes`
- `linear` focus is now called `mirrored`

### Known bugs

- Serialization definition is not final yet
- SVG Stickers don't work in IE11

## 3.6.17

### Fixed

## 3.6.16

### Fixed

- Added workaround for Safari WebGL bug when using SVG stickers

### Added

- Add translation key for zoom

## 3.6.15

### Fixed

- Fixed stickers not resized correctly when `fixedRatio` is set to `false`

## 3.6.14

### Editor

- Added `snapRotation` and `snapRotationTolerance` to sticker controls. These options allow you
  to specify values for rotation snapping. `snapRotation` defines the rotation interval (in degrees)
  at which the rotation should snap while `snapRotationTolerance` defines the tolerance around the
  `snapRotation` at which it should snap.
- Fixed exposed `ReactComponent`. For an example on how to use it, [click here](https://github.com/imgly/pesdk-react-demo).
